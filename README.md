# ASCII Art Human Experiment

## Project Description
This project, developed for a creative exploration in generative art, utilizes live video footage to create an ASCII art piece that questions the boundaries between humanity and technology. Inspired by themes similar to those in *Detroit: Become Human*, the program uses **p5.js** to capture real-time video and transform it into ASCII art. The piece features interactive text elements that remind viewers of their human essence in a digitally mediated environment.

## Features
- **ASCII Video Conversion**
  - Converts real-time video into ASCII art, displaying the phrase "I am human" using characters that match the color of the underlying video.
- **Interactive Phrase Change**
  - Clicking on the canvas toggles the displayed text between "I am human" and "I am not," adding a philosophical twist to the viewer's interaction.
- **Dynamic Text Movement**
  - The ASCII text continuously moves upward, adding a sense of motion and transformation to the piece.
