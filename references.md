2. **Optimization and Interactive Enhancements**
   - To address performance issues and add interactive elements, guidance and optimization techniques were adopted with the help of ChatGPT:
     - Suggestions to decrease canvas size and pixel size to enhance performance.
     - Implementation of dynamic text change upon canvas interaction, allowing toggling between "I am human" and "I am not."

## Inspirational Sources

- **Detroit: Become Human**
  - The thematic inspiration for using the phrase "I am human" in an ASCII art context comes from the video game *Detroit: Become Human*, which explores themes of humanity and technology. The interactive element, toggling to "I am not", adds a layer of reflection on human identity in a technologically saturated world.
